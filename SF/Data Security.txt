Data Security 


    Explain the importance of giving the right people access to the right data.
    List the four levels at which you can control data access.
    Describe a typical scenario for limiting data access at each of the four levels.

    Organization
	Objects
	Fields
	Records



    Organization-wide 
    Role 
    Sharing rules 
    Manual sharing 



    A userâ€™s profile determines the objects they can access and the things they can do with any object record (such as create, read, edit, or delete).
    Permission sets grant additional permissions and access settings to a user.

sharing model

	Private
	    Only the record owner, and users above that role in the hierarchy, can view, edit, and report on those records. 
	Public Read Only

	    All users can view and report on records, but only the owner, and users above that role in the hierarchy, can edit them.
	Public Read/Write
	    All users can view, edit, and report on all records. 
	Controlled by Parent
	    A user can view, edit, or delete a record if she can perform that same action on the record it belongs to.
